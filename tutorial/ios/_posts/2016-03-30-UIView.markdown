Coordinate
==========

UIView's property: frame, bounds, center.

frame = bounds + center.

If v2 is a subview of v1, then to center v2 within v1 you could say:

```swift
    v2.center = v1.convertPoint(v1.center, fromView:v1.superview)
```

Layout
======

TraitCollection and its four properties: displayScale, userInterfaceIdiom,
horizontalSizeClass, verticalSizeClass.

Layout is performed in three primary ways: Manual layout, Autoresizing, Autolayout.

1. Autoresizing

Autoseizing is a matter of conceptually assigning a subview "Springs and struts",
A Spring can stretch; a strut can't.

Autoresizing is simply to set autoresizingMask in code.

2. Autolayout

There are three ways to write autolayout code: NSLayoutConstraint, Anchor notation and visual format notation.
